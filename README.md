#### Usage Guide 🔬

🔗 Via Invitation Link

​	If you use the invitation link, add the bot to your server after authorization.

​	💡 At the moment, my bot is not hosted on any platform but on local server, so if I don't run it, my bot will stay **offline** forever. I'm planning and choosing it to host and run on a cloud platform. So, bear with me.
